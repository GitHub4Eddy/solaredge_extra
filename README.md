Use of the monitoring server API is subject to a query limit of 300 requests for a specific account token and a parallel query limit of 300 requests for each specific site ID from the same source IP. The monitoring server API allows up to 3 concurrent API calls from the same source IP. Any additional concurrent calls will return HTTP 429 error – too many requests.
See API documentation on https://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/se_monitoring_api.pdf
